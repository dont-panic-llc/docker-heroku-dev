# Heroku in a box for NodeJS
This is a docker environment designed to replicate as much as possible the production Heroku system. It enables local development without deviating from what is available in the Heroku environment.

``` docker-compose up ``` to start - then just code in your local environment as usual. Nodemon will auto-restart on code changes.
